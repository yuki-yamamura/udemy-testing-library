# udemy-TESTING-LIBRARY

I used this project to learn React Testing Library from [the udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-library/).
Before you run the app named Sundaes on demands, you must run [the API server(https://github.com/bonnie/udemy-TESTING-LIBRARY/tree/main/sundae-server). After that, just type `npm run start`.
